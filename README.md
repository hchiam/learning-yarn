# Learning yarn

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

Install `yarn`: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

Info on how `yarn` relates to `npm`: https://www.sitepoint.com/yarn-vs-npm/ (from 2016)

## Example commands

`yarn global` = `npm -g`

`yarn install` = `npm install`

`yarn add` = `npm add`

`yarn add --dev` = `npm add --save-dev`

`yarn licenses` (no `npm` equivalent)

`yarn why` = dependency graph and helps you see if you explicitly added a package

`yarn upgrade <...>` = `npm update <...>`
